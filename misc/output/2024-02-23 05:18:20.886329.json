[{"question": "Give me ideas on how I can use voting to achieve my goal.", "answer": "In light of the provided context, here are some possible tactics you may find useful for creating habits that will help you work on major big projects this year (2024) using voting:\n\n1. Vote for small, achievable goals: Break down your large goal into smaller, more manageable tasks. Then, vote for yourself to complete each of these smaller tasks daily or weekly until you reach your big goal. For example, if your goal is to build a new feature for an existing project this year, you could vote for yourself to spend 30 minutes researching and brainstorming ideas for the feature every day until it's completed.\n2. Make voting a habit: Vote for yourself to do something every day that will help you achieve your goal. This could be anything from reading a book related to your field, to practicing a specific skill, or even just taking a short break to clear your mind. By making voting a daily habit, you'll be more likely to stay on track and make progress towards your larger goal.\n3. Create a \"voting jar\": Write down each small task you want to complete towards your goal on a slip of paper, place them in a jar, and then vote for which task you will work on that day. This can help you avoid decision fatigue and ensure that you're making progress towards your larger goal.\n4. Vote with accountability: Share your goals with a friend or accountability partner and ask them to hold you responsible for completing the tasks you've voted for. This can provide an added layer of motivation and help you stay on track.\n5. Vote for rewards: Vote for yourself to reward yourself after completing certain tasks or reaching certain milestones. For example, you could vote for a treat or activity that you enjoy, like going for a walk or watching a favorite movie, after completing a difficult task.\n6. Make voting a game: Turn your goal into a game by setting up a point system where you earn points for completing tasks or reaching milestones. Then, vote for yourself to redeem these points for rewards or privileges. This can help make the process more enjoyable and engaging.\n7. Vote for flexibility: Don't be too rigid with your voting system. Allow yourself some flexibility in case unexpected tasks or opportunities arise. For example, if you vote to work on a specific project for two hours but then an urgent task comes up, you can vote to switch to the urgent task instead.\n8. Vote with intention: Before voting, take a moment to reflect on your intentions and motivations. Ask yourself why you want to achieve this goal and what it will mean for you once you've reached it. This can help you stay focused and motivated throughout the process.\n\nRemember, the key to successful voting is consistency and accountability. By voting regularly and holding yourself responsible for your actions, you'll be more likely to achieve your goals and build the habits you want.", "retriever": "CONTEXTUAL_LLMCHAIN_FILTER_RETRIEVER", "chosen_model_name": "llama2:7b", "number_of_relevant_docs": 20, "base_prompt": "\n            You are a helpful assistant that is versatile in so many areas of life.\n            \n            Your task is to use the context below to answer their question.\n        \n            [Context Starts]\n            {context}\n            [Context Ends]\n\n            [Question Starts]:\n            Using the context above: Goal: 'As a software engineer, I want to build habbits that will make me work on major big projects this year (2024)'. {question}.\n            [Question Ends]\n            \n            ", "source_documents": [{"title": "Habits, Productivity, and the Power of Small Wins: A Review and Analysis", "description": "This document explores various concepts related to habits, productivity, and achieving small wins.

Here are some key points related to procrastination:\n\n1. Procrastination is a result of an underlying issue: The book explains that procrastination is not just a simple lack of motivation or laziness, but rather a result of an underlying issue such as fear, anxiety, or a lack of clarity on what needs to be done.\n2. Procrastination can be a coping mechanism: Procrastination can be used as a coping mechanism to avoid dealing with uncomfortable emotions or situations. The book suggests that it's important to recognize when you are procrastinating and address the underlying issue rather than just pushing the task away.\n3. The \"Plateau of Latent Potential\": The book introduces the concept of the \"Plateau of Latent Potential,\" which refers to a state where progress is slow or non-existent, even though work has been consistent and effortful. This can be a challenging phase, but it's important to recognize that it's a normal part of the growth process.\n4. The importance of identity: The book emphasizes the importance of understanding your identity and how it relates to your goals. By aligning your habits with your identity, you can create a more sustainable approach to achieving your goals.\n5. Temptation bundling: The book introduces the concept of \"temptation bundling,\" which involves combining a desired behavior (in this case, working on major big projects) with something you already enjoy or find easy (such as watching Netflix). This can help make the behavior more attractive and increase motivation.\n\nIn summary, the book suggests that procrastination is often a result of deeper issues such as fear or anxiety, and that understanding your identity and using techniques like temptation bundling can help overcome procrastination and achieve your goals.", "retriever": "CONTEXTUAL_LLMCHAIN_FILTER_RETRIEVER", "chosen_model_name": "llama2:7b", "number_of_relevant_docs": 20, "base_prompt": "\n            You are a helpful assistant that is versatile in so many areas of life.\n            \n            Your task is to use the context below to answer their question.\n        \n            [Context Starts]\n            {context}\n            [Context Ends]\n\n            [Question Starts]:\n            Using the context above: Goal: 'As a software engineer, I want to build habbits that will make me work on major big projects this year (2024)'. {question}.\n            [Question Ends]\n            \n            ", "source_documents": [{"title": "Habits, Productivity, and the Power of Small Wins: A Review and Analysis", "description": "This document explores various concepts related to habits, productivity, and achieving small wins.

Based on the context you provided, here's a simple scenario for how you can leverage this book to achieve your goal:\n\n1. Identify your cues: Start by identifying the cues that trigger your desire to work on major big projects. These could be specific days of the week, times of day, or even certain emotions. Write these cues down in a journal or spreadsheet so you can refer to them later.\n2. Craving: Once you have identified your cues, think about what triggers your craving to work on major big projects. Is it feeling overwhelmed with tasks? Is it having a deadline looming? Write down these triggers in the same journal or spreadsheet as your cues.\n3. Response: Next, think about how you typically respond to these triggers. Do you immediately start working on the project, or do you procrastinate and put it off until later? Write down your typical response in the same journal or spreadsheet as your cues and triggers.\n4. Reward: Finally, think about what reward you receive from working on major big projects. Is it a sense of accomplishment? Is it the recognition of your peers? Write down these rewards in the same journal or spreadsheet as your cues, triggers, and responses.\n\nNow that you have this information, you can use the Four Laws of Behavior Change to design good habits that will help you achieve your goal. Here's a simple scenario for how you can do this:\n\n1. Law 1: Make it obvious - Make working on major big projects a non-negotiable part of your daily routine. Set aside dedicated time each day to work on these projects, and make sure to schedule them in your calendar.\n2. Law 2: Make it attractive - Create an environment that makes working on major big projects enjoyable and rewarding. This could involve setting up a dedicated workspace, playing music that helps you focus, or finding a work buddy who keeps you motivated.\n3. Law 3: Make it easy - Remove any obstacles that make it difficult for you to work on major big projects. This could involve automating repetitive tasks, breaking the project down into smaller, more manageable chunks, or finding ways to stay organized and focused.\n4. Law 4: Make it satisfying - Celebrate your progress along the way! Give yourself small rewards for completing milestones or reaching certain goals, and reflect on how far you've come. This will help you stay motivated and engaged in the process of building these habits.\n\nBy following these steps and using the Four Laws of Behavior Change as a framework, you can design good habits that will help you achieve your goal of working on major big projects this year (2024).
