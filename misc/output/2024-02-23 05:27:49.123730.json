[{"question": "Give me ideas on how I can use voting to achieve my goal.", "answer": "To achieve your goal of building habits as a software engineer to work on major big projects in 2024, you can leverage the concept of \"voting\" to influence your behavior and mindset. Here are some ideas on how you can use voting to achieve your goal:\n\n1. Create an implementation intention: When situation X (i.e., feeling unmotivated or procrastinating) arises, vote for yourself to take action immediately. For example, \"I will spend 30 minutes working on my project right now.\"\n2. Use visual cues: Place sticky notes or reminders in strategic locations where you'll see them often, such as on your computer monitor or next to your bed. Each time you see the note, vote for yourself to take action towards your goal.\n3. Set up an accountability system: Share your goals with a friend or accountability partner and ask them to hold you responsible. When you meet your goals, celebrate the win and cast another vote for yourself.\n4. Track your progress: Keep track of your progress towards your goal by using a habit tracker or project management tool. Each time you complete a task or milestone, cast a vote for yourself as a reward.\n5. Use gamification: Make your goal more engaging by turning it into a game. Create a scoreboard or leaderboard where you can track your progress and compete with yourself or others. Each time you achieve a milestone, cast a vote for yourself as a reward.\n6. Celebrate small wins: Instead of waiting for the end goal, celebrate each small win along the way. For example, when you complete a minor task, cast a vote for yourself as a reward. This will help you stay motivated and focused on your goal.\n7. Create a countdown: Set up a countdown timer for your goal, and each time you make progress, cast a vote for yourself as a reward. This will help you stay focused and motivated towards your goal.\n8. Use social pressure: Share your goals with friends or colleagues and ask them to hold you accountable. When you meet your goals, celebrate the win and cast another vote for yourself.\n9. Make it a habit: Incorporate voting into your daily routine by making it a habit. For example, every day at 8 am, cast a vote for yourself as a reminder to stay focused on your goal.\n10. Be consistent: Consistency is key when using voting to achieve your goals. Make sure to cast a vote for yourself every time you work on your project, no matter how small the task may be.\n\nBy incorporating these ideas into your daily routine, you can leverage the power of voting to build habits and stay motivated towards achieving your goal of working on major big projects in 2024 as a software engineer.", "retriever": "CONTEXTUAL_LLMCHAIN_FILTER_RETRIEVER", "chosen_model_name": "llama2:7b", "number_of_relevant_docs": 4, "base_prompt": "\n            You are a helpful assistant that is versatile in so many areas of life.\n            \n            Your task is to use the context below to answer their question.\n        \n            [Context Starts]\n            {context}\n            [Context Ends]\n\n            [Question Starts]:\n            Using the context above: Goal: 'As a software engineer, I want to build habbits that will make me work on major big projects this year (2024)'. {question}.\n            [Question Ends]\n            \n            ", "source_documents": [{"title": "Habits, Productivity, and the Power of Small Wins: A Review and Analysis", "description": "This document explores various concepts related to habits, productivity, and achieving small wins.

Here's a simple scenario for how you can leverage the book \"Atomic Habits\" to achieve your goal of working on major big projects in 2024:\n\n1. Start by identifying the specific habits that will help you achieve your goal. For example, you may want to focus on building habits related to time management, prioritization, and productivity.\n2. Read through the book and take notes on the strategies and techniques that resonate with you. Highlight or underline key passages that provide actionable advice for building good habits.\n3. Identify the small changes you can make in your daily routine to support your goal. For example, you may want to start by setting aside a specific time each day for focused work on your big projects, or by breaking down larger tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks.\n4. Create an implementation plan that outlines the steps you will take to build these habits. Be specific about when and how you will practice these habits, and hold yourself accountable to your plan.\n5. Track your progress using a habit tracker or journal. Write down each day's successes and setbacks, and reflect on what worked well and what didn't. Use this information to adjust your plan as needed.\n6. Celebrate small victories along the way. By focusing on incremental progress, you will stay motivated and engaged in the process of building new habits.\n7. Continuously learn and improve. Read books, articles, or attend workshops that can help you to develop new skills or expand your knowledge.\n8. Surround yourself with people who support and encourage you. Having a community of like-minded individuals can provide valuable accountability and inspiration.\n9. Be patient and persistent. Building good habits takes time, and it's normal to encounter setbacks along the way. Don't get discouraged if you miss a day or two, but instead learn from your mistakes and keep moving forward.\n10. Finally, remember that small habits can lead to significant changes over time.
